# Overview
- These guidelines consolidate procedural, safety, quality, testing, approval and impairment‑rating rules across operational, manufacturing, procurement, change‑control and medical assessment domains.
- They set mandatory documentation, approval and review timelines, define inspection/sampling/testing escalation rules, and require traceable recordkeeping and role accountability.
- Clinical sections define diagnostic, testing and rating requirements for multiple medical specialties (transfusion, diabetes, pulmonary, cardiac, neurologic, ENT, ophthalmology, musculoskeletal, dermatology, etc.) and map objective findings to impairment/compensation decisions.
- Emphasis is on written applications/requests, risk‑based controls, formal approvals, audit trails, and escalation routes for exceptions or unresolved issues.

# Key Principles
- Always use written, complete documentation before action (no verbal or incomplete submissions).
- Approvals and deviations require explicit written authorization from the competent authority or designated approver.
- Risk‑based testing and verification: critical items/functions require 100% inspection/verification; lower‑risk items may be sampled per approved plans.
- Separate environments and staged validation for technical changes: test/staging before production, with rollback plans and audit evidence.
- Preserve chain‑of‑custody, traceability and retention of records for all inspections, tests, approvals and corrective actions.
- Non‑compliance or safety breaches trigger immediate stop, quarantine, investigation and remedial action.
- Use objective evidence (measurements, calibrated instruments, pathology, imaging, lab tests) to support decisions, ratings and corrective actions.
- Multidisciplinary review for complex, borderline or high‑risk cases; escalate when unresolved.

  - Step 3: Schedule on‑site inspections if required; obtain written approval before commencing work.
  - Step 4: Implement plan; stop work for any unapproved material changes and obtain written reapproval.

- Inspection, Sampling & Lot Release:
  - Step 1: Follow approved sampling plan for routine lots; document plan’s sampling percentages and acceptance criteria.
  - Step 2: Perform 100% inspection when packaging/seal compromised, on committee mandate, or when samples show critical failures.
  - Step 3: Quarantine suspect lots, stop release, investigate and document corrective actions.
  - Step 4: Obtain committee/manager approval before releasing lots with known deviations or changed sampling plans.

- Procurement, Acceptance Testing & Software Delivery:
  - Step 1: Produce written justification and technical specifications; define acceptance criteria and test plan.
  - Step 2: Contractor delivers artifacts and documentation; QA executes acceptance tests per plan.
  - Step 3: Classify defects by severity; critical defects fixed immediately; re‑test and document results.
  - Step 4: Formal acceptance, conditional acceptance, or rejection recorded; apply contractual remedies for delays/defects as required.

- Change Management & Releases:
  - Step 1: Submit formal change request including scope, impact analysis, test/rollback plans and schedule.
  - Step 2: Reviewer assesses risk and testing level; approve, reject or request revisions in writing.
  - Step 3: Test in representative non‑production environment; attach test evidence to request.
  - Step 4: Implement during approved window; perform post‑implementation verification and retain audit evidence; roll back if criteria unmet.

- Corrective Action & Nonconformance Handling:
  - Step 1: On detection, implement immediate containment and document a corrective‑action plan (scope, responsibility, schedule).
  - Step 2: Perform required sampling/testing in accredited labs with chain‑of‑custody; record results.
  - Step 3: Approving authority reviews and signs off on corrective measures; allow conditional/resumed operations only with documented mitigations.
  - Step 4: Retain records, escalate persistent/recurrent issues to higher committee.

- Clinical Evaluation & Impairment Rating (medical claims):
  - Step 1: Collect full medical dossier and objective evidence (imaging, lab, pathology, PFTs, ECG/ECHO, EMG/NCS, visual fields, audiometry as relevant).
  - Step 2: Specialist evaluates, applies condition‑specific severity bands/percentage tables and documents tests and rationale.
  - Step 3: Committee reviews; may request additional tests or expert opinion; finalize rating and record decision and appeals info.

- Neurophysiology / EMG / EEG Workflow:
  - Step 1: Confirm clinical indication and perform focused neurological exam.
  - Step 2: Perform appropriate EEG/NCS/EMG using standard montages/protocols; time needle EMG to capture denervation (typically weeks after injury).
  - Step 3: Interpret, correlate with exam and report findings, localization and recommendations.
  - Step 4: Communicate urgent findings immediately to the referring team.

# Mandatory Requirements (Must-Do)
- Submit complete written applications/plans and safety/rescue documentation before any work or procurement commences.
- Obtain explicit written approval from the competent authority before starting work, deploying changes to production, or accepting major procurements.
- Maintain traceable records of approvals, inspections, tests, sampling plans, corrective actions and retention for audit.
- Perform 100% inspection when packaging/seals are tampered, when committee mandates it, or if sampled units show critical/nonconforming results.
- Quarantine suspect lots, stop release and investigate upon detection of failures.
- Use accredited laboratories and chain‑of‑custody procedures for sampling and testing.
- Provide rollback and verification plans with all production/deployment changes; rollback immediately if acceptance criteria fail.
- For clinical decisions: document objective evidence (tests, imaging, pathology), obtain specialist reports when required, and retain full medical dossiers for adjudication.
- Implement documented corrective‑action plans immediately upon nonconformity detection and obtain approver sign‑off for continuation/exception.
- Use lowest effective dose and defined review/stop dates when prescribing antipsychotics for BPSD; obtain informed consent.

# Prohibited Actions (Must-Not)
- MUST NOT commence work, production changes, procurement acceptance, or software deployment on the basis of verbal or incomplete approvals.
- MUST NOT proceed with material deviations from approved plans without written authorization from the competent authority.
- MUST NOT release or certify lots suspected of contamination, tampering, or with failed critical tests.
- MUST NOT transfuse platelets in TTP routinely (avoid unless life‑threatening hemorrhage and after hematology consultation).
- MUST NOT implement production/production configuration changes in production without prior approval, except under defined emergency procedures with retroactive documentation.
- MUST NOT use non‑GLP or unaccredited lab results as sole basis for clinical or acceptance decisions where GLP/accredited testing is required.
- MUST NOT double‑count the same functional impairment when combining medical ratings; follow combination rules.

# Exceptions / Edge Cases
- Expedited or emergency interventions:
  - MAY use expedited review or emergency change procedures, but written retroactive approval, documentation and higher‑level sign‑off are required as soon as practicable.
- Minor modifications:
  - MAY be allowed via prior written notification for predefined low‑risk changes; otherwise full reapproval required.
- Non‑response by authority:
  - If no response within the 9 or 15 working‑day windows, applicants SHOULD escalate rather than assume tacit approval.
- Sampling adjustments:
  - Changes to sampling percent, acceptance criteria or destructive testing scope MUST be approved by the designated committee/manager before implementation.
- Temporary/conditional operations:
  - MAY be permitted under strict controls, documented mitigations and with approver sign‑off; must include monitoring and fixed review date.
- Medical/clinical exceptions:
  - Urgent treatment (e.g., biopsy, pericardiocentesis, life‑saving surgery) MUST not be delayed for adjudication; document and submit records promptly.
- Laboratory/testing timing:
  - Early EMG may be nondiagnostic for axonal injury; repeat testing at appropriate interval (≈2–4 weeks) is recommended.
- High impairment ratings or atypical percentages:
  - Entries marked conditional or requiring committee/board review MUST be escalated with supporting objective evidence before final assignment.

# Practical Checklist
