  "call_summary": "The claimant reports two distinct disabling conditions: a recent fracture of the backbone (spine) that the claimant says is preventing them from working, and a pre-existing learning-disability diagnosis (dyslexia) together with ADHD. The claimant stated the backbone fracture was first diagnosed three months ago and that work difficulties / lost income began at the same time. The claimant also said they will upload two documents that relate the two diagnoses (learning disability and the backbone injury) and noted the learning-disability evaluation originates from a licensed specialist at Ariel University.\n\nDuring the call the AI intake agent confirmed both the spine fracture and the learning-disability/ADHD diagnoses and requested dates, descriptions and functional detail; the claimant supplied only the diagnosis timing for the fracture (three months ago) and indicated intention to upload documentation but did not provide more clinical detail about treatment, imaging, surgery, medications, or specific functional limitations (e.g., mobility, sitting/standing tolerance, lifting restrictions). The intake agent explained that the formal submission to the medical committee requires medical evaluation reports and imaging for the fracture and a licensed learning-disability/ADHD evaluation; the agent referenced committee documentation requirements for diagnostic confirmation and functional limitation statements.\n\nQuality of information gathered: basic and relevant identifiers were captured (primary conditions and approximate diagnosis date for the fracture), plus intent to upload two supporting documents. Significant gaps remain: no exact diagnosis date (calendar date), no details about which spinal levels were injured, no imaging or operative/treatment details, no objective functional measures (e.g., inability to sit/stand, specific lifting limits, use of assistive devices), and no timeline or documentation for the learning-disability/ADHD diagnosis (age at diagnosis, testing results, medications). The intake referenced committee standards for neurocognitive/ADHD documentation and the need for specialist reports to confirm functional impact  .",
  "documents_requested_list": [
    "Orthopedic/spine specialist medical evaluation report describing the backbone fracture, including clinical findings, spinal level(s) involved, fracture type (compression, burst, transverse process, etc.), and the date of first diagnosis.",
    "Complete spine imaging reports and images (dated) — X‑ray, CT and/or MRI scans of the spine that show the fracture; include radiologist reports and image CDs or digital files.",
    "Emergency department record(s) and initial hospital admission notes (if applicable) from the date of injury/diagnosis, including triage notes, vital signs, initial imaging and treating physician documentation.",
    "Operative report(s) and anesthesia records (if any spinal surgery was performed) describing the procedure, implants, and postoperative plan.",
    "Orthopedic/neurology follow‑up notes documenting ongoing treatment, pain management (medication lists with start dates and dosages), referrals (e.g., physiotherapy) and objective functional findings (range of motion, neurologic exam, gait, use of assistive devices).",
    "Physiotherapy / rehabilitation records documenting therapy dates, functional progress, restrictions and recommendations.",
    "Pain-specialist or interventional spine clinic notes if injections, nerve blocks, or other procedures were performed.",
    "Medication list and pharmacy dispensing records for pain and other related medications (dates and dosages).",
    "Work/employment records showing loss of income: employer letters specifying sick leave dates, work restrictions, termination or modified duty offers (if any), recent pay stubs, payroll records, and dates of reduced hours or absence.",
    "Personal statement / chronology from claimant detailing date/time of injury (if traumatic), symptom progression, limitations in daily activities (difficulty sitting, standing, walking, lifting, driving, concentrating), and exact dates when work ability changed.",
    "Learning‑disability/neuropsychological evaluation from the licensed specialist (Ariel University or equivalent) including full neuropsychological testing battery, diagnosis (dyslexia, ADHD), testing scores, clinical interview notes, and the date(s) of testing and diagnosis.",
    "Psychiatry/psychology notes documenting ADHD diagnostic interview, symptom history, functional impairment in educational, social and occupational domains, and treatment plan (including any prescribed stimulant or non‑stimulant medication with start dates). Cite addenda linking ADHD impact to occupational functioning.",
    "School records or prior educational assessments that document dyslexia history and academic accommodations (IEP, testing accommodations) to establish onset and chronicity of the learning disability.",
    "Any correspondence, opinion letters or reports that explicitly connect the learning disabilities/ADHD and the spine injury (i.e., documents the claimant referenced saying the two disabilities are related).",
    "Primary care physician notes covering the 12 months before and after the fracture (to show baseline functioning and any pre‑existing limitations).",
    "Any Social Worker, Occupational Therapy, or Head-of‑Unit statements addressing functional capacity, need for assistance, or ADL limitations.",
    "If relevant, occupational health reports or fitness-for-duty evaluations performed by employer or third-party clinicians."

  "case_summary": "Claimant reports a spinal (backbone) fracture diagnosed three months ago that the claimant says has caused inability to work and income loss; the claimant also has pre-existing learning disabilities (dyslexia) and ADHD supported by evaluations from a licensed specialist (Ariel University). Current documentation is incomplete — only the fracture timing (3 months ago) and the existence of learning‑disability/ADHD records were provided; claimant intends to upload two supporting documents.",
  "key_legal_points": [
    "Spine fracture diagnosed: claimant stated diagnosis occurred \"3 months ago\" (no exact calendar date recorded).",
    "Work impact timeline: claimant reported work difficulties and lost income beginning concurrently with the fracture diagnosis (three months ago).",
    "Primary diagnoses: backbone (spinal) fracture (3 months prior), and learning disabilities including dyslexia and ADHD (dates of original diagnosis/testing not provided).",
    "Functional limitations: claimant asserts inability to work due to the fracture but provided no objective functional measures during the call (no sitting/standing duration, lifting limits, gait or neurologic deficits recorded).",
    "Evidence currently missing and critical for adjudication: imaging (X‑ray/CT/MRI) for the fracture, orthopedist/neurology clinical notes with level/type of fracture and treatment plan, operative records (if any), and detailed neuropsychological/ADHD testing reports documenting functional impairment and onset for learning disabilities.",
    "Documentation standards: ADHD diagnosis and functional impact must be documented by clinical interview and, as appropriate, standardized testing and neuropsychological evaluation per committee standards referenced in the guidance documents .",
    "Spine / lumbosacral nerve root impairment guidance may affect percentage assessment if neurologic deficit documented — committee criteria reference lumbosacral root and peripheral nerve impairment categories relevant to a spinal injury assessment .",
    "Retroactivity implications: the fracture claim’s retroactivity would generally be anchored to the date of diagnosis/onset (three months ago) subject to medical documentation; the learning‑disability/ADHD claim may permit earlier retroactive consideration if prior educational/medical records document longstanding impairment (dates for those records are missing)."
